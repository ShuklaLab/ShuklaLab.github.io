# Research
Shukla Lab aims in developing:
* Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) based computational methods for in silico biomarker discovery and patientsâ€™ stratification in inflammatory diseases, cancer and multimorbidity via exploiting high-throughput omics, clinical and healthcare data. For more details regarding software and tools developed from our lab please see our [Github repository](https://github.com/ShuklaLab).
* Positive Pedagogy based learning & teaching (L&T) methods for cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary subjects taught in a multi-disciplinary course environment in higher education (HE) sector. For more details regarding this theme of research, please see [here](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/intervention-through-teaching-and-learning-practice-addressing-stress-and-anxiety) and [here](https://ciernetwork.wordpress.com/).
