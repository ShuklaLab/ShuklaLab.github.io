Shukla Lab aims in developing Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) based computational methods for in silico biomarker discovery and patientsâ€™ stratification in inflammatory diseases, cancer and multimorbidity via exploiting high-throughput omics, clinical and healthcare data. For more details of our software and tools see our [Github repository](https://github.com/ShuklaLab).
